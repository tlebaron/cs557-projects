\section{Exploitation}
The proof of concept can be run following:

\begin{itemize}
\item If logged as root, change your permission to user with {\tt su - user}
\item You should already be in the {\tt home/user/} folder. If not, execute {\tt cd home/folder}
\item The exploit is the {\tt exploit.sh} file. Simply execute it with {\tt sh exploit.sh}
\item Enjoy your new privileges.
\end{itemize}
