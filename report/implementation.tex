The following steps must be followed to get privilege escalation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compile the code with:  {\tt gcc -o access\_to\_the\_peanutcave\_reboot access\_to\_the\_peanutcave\_reboot.c}. Note that we do not have to disable any default stack protections such as stack canaries or ASLR. 
\item The exploit can be run with this command: {\tt access\_to\_the\_peanutcave\_rebot 4660}. This includes the first argument as 0x1234, the value it needs to be to clear the second lock.
\item On the first prompt type 4220229742 which will correctly XOR with the random number to provide {\tt0x9000dd09} and unlock the first lock
\item On the second prompt type a padding of size 32 followed by {\tt /bin/shh}, this will overflow {\tt buffer} into {\tt buffer2} and in doing so allow us to pass {\tt /bin/shh} as an argument to execve to launch the shell.
\end{enumerate}
