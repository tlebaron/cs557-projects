The following steps must be followed to get privilege escalation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compile the code with:  {\tt gcc -o peanut peanut.c}. Note that we do not have to disable any default stack protections such as stack canaries or ASLR. 
\item The exploit can be run with this command: THOMAS PUT COMMAND HERE this includes the first argument as 0x1234, the value it needs to be to clear the second lock
\item On the first prompt type X which will correctly XOR with the random number to provide \tt{0x9000dd09} and unlock the first lock
\item On the second prompt type ILOVEPEANUT unlocking the second lock
\item On the third prompt type a padding of size X followed by \tt{/bin/shh}, this will overflow \tt{buffer} into \tt{buffer2} and in doing so allow us to pass \tt{/bin/shh} as an argument to execve to launch the shell.
\end{enumerate}
