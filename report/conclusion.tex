\section{Conclusion}
We presented in this work how to use a format string vulnerability to overwrite the global offset table to get control of the flow of the program. We also demonstrate how to use this flow to chain ROP gadgets which can be used to execute arbitrary code like the execve("/bin/shh") we needed here.
This paper also introduce how to use the mprotect() function to make the stack executable again, in order to be able to run a hand-made shellcode, like we did in the previous project.
