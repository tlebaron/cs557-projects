\section{Conclusion}
In this work we have introduced a new challenge binary access\_to\_the\_peanut\_cave, a binary with a series of three locks that can be exploited to launch a shell. We also showed how to exploit this binary by explaining the vulnerabilities in the rand() function in C, the affect of using the read function on a given file descriptor, and how our buffer overflow allows the user to modify sensitive data to launch a shell.
