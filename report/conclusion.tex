\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Comments on the vulnerability}
It seems that the issue with GNU Screen 4.5 is not a code bug. We did not use code vulnerabilities and techniques we learnt in the CS557 classe to get privilege escalation. The main issue with Screen is a design mistake. The devlopers of the softwares did not conceive that opening the logfiles in root privileges could be used to create root-owned files.
