\section{Introduction}
\emph{GNU Screen} is a terminal multiplexer which allow the user to access multiple processes from an unique terminal. It is the shell version of a window manager. In 2017, Screen 4.5 presented a vulnerability allowing a user to get root privileges in the local machine running the program. The vulnerability of this version of the program came from the fact that it opened logfiles in root privileges. In this work we show a proof of concept of how this vulnerability can be used to get root privileges.
