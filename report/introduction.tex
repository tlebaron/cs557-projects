\section{Introduction}
\emph{access\_to\_the\_peanutcave\_reboot} is a challenge binary that leverages multiple types of challenges as locks that an attacker has to break through in order to launch a shell. In order to solve these locks an attacker must have knowledge of randomization in C, linux file read conventions, and buffer overflows. In this work we explain our challenge binary \emph{access\_to\_the\_peanutcave\_reboot} as well as providing details on how to exploit it.
